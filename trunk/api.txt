Most configuration of the Flashy video player is done through FlashVars.  A
basic list of supported properties follows.  Sample code implies the use of
swfobject, but Flashy is compatible with swfobject and swfembed or even
straight HTML.

For use with Drupal, use the Flashy module and the dependent SWFEmbed module:

video
  so.addVariable("video", "video.flv");

Specifies a single video file to play.  This parameter is optional, but if absent,
video player depends on the playlist parameter.  The value may contain a fully
qualified or relative file path.  In terms of Flash Player, relative paths take
their point of view from the HTML document that houses in the SWF, except in the
case of video:  video files take their point of view from the SWF itself.

poster
  so.addVariable("poster", "poster.jpg");

Specifies a poster image (stand-in frame) for a single video file.  This
parameter is optional.

playlist
  so.addVariable("playlist", "playlist.xml");

Specifies an XSPF-formatted XML playlist for a series of video files.  This
parameter is optional, but if absent, video player depends on the video parameter.
The value may contain a fully qualified or relative file path.  In terms of Flash
Player, relative paths take their point of view from the HTML document that houses
in the SWF.  If the video parameter is set in addition to the playlist parameter,
the additional single video is prepended to the playlist.  See the included
playlist.xml file for an example.

uiAutoHide
  so.addVariable("uiAutoHide", "true");

Determines whether playback controls auto hide (true) or always show (false).
This parameter is optional.  Only applies when controls are present.  Auto hide
means controls show when the user moves the mouse over the video player.
Default is false.

uiControls
  so.addVariable("uiControls", "PlayPause|Prev|Next|Seek|Volume|FullScreen|MuteUnmute");

Determines which playback controls to display, and in what order.  This parameter
is optional.  The value is a pipe-delimited string, as shown.  To specify no
controls, set the value to none.  Video player will only show Prev and Next
buttons if a playlist is specified, even if those buttons are configured as part
of the value.  Video player will only show FullScreen button if Flash Player 9.0.115.0
or higher is installed, even if that button is configured as part of the value.
Default configuration is as shown.

uiColors
  so.addVariable("uiColors", "#734D26|#734D26|#734D26|#734D26|#734D26|#734D26|#734D26");

Determines foreground color of playback controls in hexadecimal value.  This
parameter is optional.  The value is a pipe-delimited string, as shown.  This
list parallels the list in the uiControls parameter.  Default is black.

uiBgColor
  so.addVariable("uiBgColor", "#65B87E|#4E7058");

Determines background color of control panel (the rectangle that holds the
playback controls) in hexadecimal value.  This parameter is optional.  Value is
a pipe-delimited string, as shown.  If two colors are configured, the background
color is a gradient; if one color is configured, the background color is solid.
Default is a gradient between a light gray (top) to a slightly darker gray (bottom).

autoPlay
  so.addVariable("autoPlay", "true");

Determines whether video plays automatically (true) or waits for user
interaction (false).  This parameter is optional.  If set to false, then user
must initiate playback for single videos or for each video in a playlist.
Default is false.

loop
  so.addVariable("loop", "true");

Determines whether video loops automatically (true) or stops at the end of
playback (false).  This parameter is optional.  If set to true, videos in a
playlist loop on the playlist, rather than individually.  Default is false.

volume
  so.addVariable("volume", "5");

Sets the volume of video playback.  This parameter is optional.  Values range
from 0 (mute) to 100 (full volme).  Default is 100.

maintainAspectRatio
  so.addVariable("maintainAspectRatio", "false");

Determines whether video maintains aspect ratio (true) or not (false) when SWF
container is resized to a different aspect.  When set to true, video might
display in letterbox or pillarbox format.  Default is true.
