We found that there was a shortage of flash video wrapper players in the world that were released under a fully-Free license.  There were various ones released under a CC-non-commercial license, or under a "GPL but only for the ad-ridden version" license, but none that just got out of your way and let you get work done.

So we wrote one.  Flashy is a pure-AS3 flash video wrapper.  You do not need the Flash development IDE to use or compile it, only the free compiler from Adobe and a text editor.

The goal is to make Flashy as flexible and configurable as possible so that it can be modified and extended by the community or by a particular user on a particular site.  Most configuration is done through flashvars to minimize the need to tweak code.
